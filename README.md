# Template
Template project in C# and .NET Core 6.0, used to build over it new applications in less time.

It has lots of features to quickly access most Windows applications and folders. It also includes a native dark mode, never seen before in C# (at least by me). It has a dual CRC and hash generator to even compare 2 files at once and see if they are the same or not. It even has an icon extractor, which converts all the found icons from any file to PNG images with 16 x 16 and 32 x 32 and adds a fuchsia border around each icon to quickly see its real borders. It even has full control over all the power functions of any PC, like starting any screen saver at will, turning off the monitor screen, lock the user's session, suspend, hibernate, close the session, and finally restart or shutdown the computer. It also goes beyond by including some "hacks" like pausing the system clock (for that the tool must be start as an administrator, since it keeps the clock at the same date and time while it's desired by the user), or even killing any task manager, Windows start menu or explorer, although these options should never be used with any bad intention, they are included just a demo test of what is possible to accomplish within C# .NET applications. It includes another tool to preview most of the scores composed by JÃºpiter Mauro (Jupisoft). Feel free to give any suggestions for improvements :-)
